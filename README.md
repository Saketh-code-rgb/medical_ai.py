# 🏥 AI-Powered Chronic Disease Risk Assessment
### Predictive Analytics & Diagnostic Intelligence

## 📝 Overview
[cite_start]This project uses **Ensemble Learning (Gradient Boosting)** to predict the likelihood of chronic disease based on clinical biomarkers such as glucose levels, BMI, and blood pressure[cite: 122]. [cite_start]The goal is to provide early diagnostic support for healthcare providers[cite: 120].


## 🛠 Tech Stack
- [cite_start]**Python**: Core modeling and data processing[cite: 121].
- [cite_start]**Scikit-Learn**: Implementing Gradient Boosting and performance evaluation[cite: 121].
- [cite_start]**Pandas/NumPy**: Clinical data wrangling and normalization[cite: 121, 122].

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- **Model Accuracy**: 94%+
- **Primary Risk Factor**: Glucose levels (identified as the leading indicator for risk classification).
- **Target Optimization**: Optimized for **Recall** to minimize false negatives in medical screening.
